\f0\fs24 \cf0 The SAR data are obtained as a result of a PSI analysis through StaMPS software.\
The given time series have been unwrapped with respect to PS number 3 - to replicate the GNSS reference master S0. Then, each time series has been interpolated with cubic splines and the value in correspondence of the first epoch has been subtracted to the raw data, to make them coherent with the GNSS time series.}
